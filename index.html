  <p>The life of a mussel is not very interesting but its more about the end of their life than what happens during it.Such as when
    they are born, as free swimming larvae, they eventually develop shells and live the rest of their boring life just sitting in 
    one spot, until marvelous people come and harvest them and deliver them to restaurants such as red lobster who make a delicious
    mussel mean with garlic bread and broth. <p>
    The succulene of their juices when mixed in garlic pan fried with some garlic bread as an addition is absoulutely delicious and I 
    recommend it to every avid seafood fan. Here is a link to Red Lobster's
